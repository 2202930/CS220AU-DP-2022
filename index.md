## What is Palm Oil, and why can it be considered an Existential Risk? ##

Palm Oil is high quality ingredient that is used for a number of different reasons. It is an ingredient found in food products, detergents, cosmetics and biofuel. Palm Oil can be found in close to 50% of the packaged products found in supermarkets. Palm Oil is a very productive crop, it offers a greater yield at a lower cost than other vegetable oils. 

The demand for palm oil is rapidly increasing, meaning that the Global Production of palm oil is also increasing. In order to keep up with this trend, palm oil plantations have been spreading across Asia, Africa and Latin America. The expansion of these plantations is proving to be detrimental to Tropical Rainforests which form as critical habitats for a number of endagered species, including the Orangutan, the Pygmy Elephant and Sumatran Rhino. 

Therefore, palm oil can be considered as an existential risk due to the fact that it is leading to the collapse of ecosystems.

## What impact does Palm Oil have on the environment and animal habitats?

Large areas of tropical forests and other ecosystems with high conservation values have been and are being cleared to make room for palm oil plantations. As a result, a number of critical habitats being destroyed for a number of endangered species. In order to make room for these plantations, the forests are burned down, releasing smoke and CO2 into the atmosphere, which then makes room for the crop; this makes it a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in turn contributing to climate change. 

Palm Oil and the expansion of palm oil plantations are having a devestating impact on a number of plant and animal habitats, these habitats are being destroyed to make room for these plantations.


## What is the Palm Oil campaign? 

Supporters of the palm oil campaign realise that they cannot completely stop brands and companies from using palm oil in their products. Instead,they should strive to ensure that they support and instead use Sustainable Palm Oil. 

Chester Zoo suports the Sustainable palm oil Campaign, they state that their mission is "preventing extinction, and a big part of that is aiming to be a major force in conserving biodiversity worldwide." As well as supporting the Sustainability of palm oil, Chester Zoo "carry out work directly in habitats around the world affected by palm oil production."

WWF raise awareness on the impact that palm oil has, their website is incredibly useful in learning about palm oil. Their website states that "In 2012, the UK Government recognised that we were part of the palm oil problem and could also be part of the solution. They set a commitment for 100% of the palm oil used in the UK to be from sustsainable sources that do not harm people or nature." This Government commitment proved to be helpful for the palm oil campaign, the WWF website states that in "2019, 70% of the total palm oil imports to the UK were sustainable". 

## What are charities and campaigns doing now?

Charities and campaigns are doing a number of different things to raise awareness about the impact that palm oil is having on ecosystems and the climate. 

Charities are working towards finding ways of sourcing palm oil without destroying and harming ecosystems and the environment. 

WWF "believe that palm oil production does not have to be destructive and can be produced responsibly as part of sustainable

## How has social media positively contributed to raising awareness about the campaign?

Social media and presence online can be considered as an incredibly useful tool for raising awareness on environmenal campaigns. Harmeet Kaur and Jaya Gera conducted research on the 'Effect of Social Media Connectivity on Success of Crowdfunding Campaigns' and stated that "To make a campaign successful, it is important to publicise and promote it on a large scale over social media." Kaur and Gera go on to state that their research study shows "that social interaction and connectivity have a positive impact on the success of a campaign." 

The Iceland 2018 Christmas Advert-

In 2018, supermarket chain *'Iceland'* created an advert with the aim to "raise awareness of the critical issue" of palm oil and the impact that Palm Oil plantations were having on ecosystems, in particular the impact it was having on the Orangutans, this advert was known as the *'Rang-tan'*,Sir Malcom Walker, founder of the Iceland supermarket chain, stated that the advert had received "70 million views and counting online".

At the start of 2018, Sir Malcom Walker decided that his supermarket chain would go Palm Oil free, with all own brand products free from palm oil, he stated that he was influenced to do this due to his son "Richard's passion around tropical deforestation...". The 'Rang-tan' animation used in the advert originally belonged to a campaign group known as 'Greenpeace'. Sir Malcom Walker had hoped that removing Greenpeace's branding from the video would meant that Iceland would have "a good chance of being cleared for broadcast." Unfortunately, this was not the case the advert was considered to be too political to be shown on Television. Despite this, the video was still widely watched, meaning that awareness about the issue of Palm Oil was still being spread. Social media and the internet played a significant part in ensuring the message about the damage that Palm Oil was causing was spread. Online platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and Twitter ensured that video was seen and shared. The advert was incredibly effective, Sir Malcom Walker stated that "marketing gurus were falling over themselves to pronounce it the most ‘persuasive’ and ‘effective’ ad of 2018." Despite being banned, "more than 1 million people signed a petition to have it shown on TV", proving that the video had been effective. This proves that social media has positively contributed to raising awareness about the palm oil campaign, as it ensured that the video was still shared and awareness was continuing to be raised about the effects that palm oil has on ecosystems and the envrionment.

## Conclusion ##

In Conclusion, social media and our presence online can be considered to positively contribute to raising awareness about the palm oil campaign. Without social media and an online presence, understanding and learning about the impacts of palm oil would be very difficult. Kaur and Gera's study indicate that  to make a successful campaign, it is "important to publicise and promote it on a large scale over social media" implying that an online presence positively contributes to raising awareness about campaigns. The banned 'Rang-Tan' 'Iceland' advert proves that an online presence can positively contribute to raising awareness the palm oil campaign, as online platforms were incredibly helpful in sharing an informative video that showed the public the impacts that palm oil plantations were causing to Orungatans ecosystems as well as the impact the plantations were having on the environment.
