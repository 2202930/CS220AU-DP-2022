## What is Palm Oil, and why can it be considered an Existential Risk? ##

Palm Oil is high quality ingredient that is used for a number of different reasons. It is an ingredient found in food products, detergents, cosmetics and biofuel. Palm Oil can be found in close to 50% of the packaged products found in supermarkets. Palm Oil is a very productive crop, it offers a greater yield at a lower cost than other vegetable oils. 

The demand for Palm Oil is rapidly increasing, meaning that the Global Production of Palm Oil is also increasing. In order to keep up with this trend, Palm Oil plantations have been spreading across Asia, Africa and Latin America. The expansion of these plantations is proving to be detrimental to Tropical Rainforests which form as critical habitats for a number of endagered species, including the Orangutan, the Pygmy Elephant and Sumatran Rhino. 

Therefore, Palm Oil can be considered as an existential risk due to the fact that it is leading to the collapse of ecosystems.
