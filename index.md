## What is an Existential Risk? ##

An Existential Risk is a risk that has the potential of eliminating all of humanity and its ecosystems. They can be Environmental Risks, Natural Risks, Biotech Risks and Artifical Intelligence Risks.

## What is Palm Oil, and why can it be considered an Existential Risk? ##

Palm Oil is high quality ingredient that is used for a number of different reasons. It is an ingredient found in food products, detergents, cosmetics and biofuel. Palm Oil can be found in close to 50% of the packaged products found in supermarkets. Palm Oil is a very productive crop, it offers a greater yield at a lower cost than other vegetable oils. 

The demand for Palm Oil is rapidly increasing, meaning that the Global Production of Palm Oil is also increasing. In order to keep up with this trend, Palm Oil plantations have been spreading across Asia, Africa and Latin America. The expansion of these plantations is proving to be detrimental to Tropical Rainforests which form as critical habitats for a number of endagered species, including the Orangutan, the Pygmy Elephant and Sumatran Rhino. 

Therefore, Palm Oil can be considered as an existential risk due to the fact that it is leading to the collapse of ecosystems.

## What impact does Palm Oil have on the environment and animal habitats?

Large areas of tropical forests and other ecosystems with high conservation values have been and are being cleared to make room for Palm Oil plantations. As a result, a number of critical habitats being destroyed for a number of endangered species. In order to make room for these plantations, the forests are burned down, releasing smoke and CO2 into the atmosphere, which then makes room for the crop; this makes it a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in turn contributing to climate change. 

Palm Oil and the expansion of Palm Oil plantations are having a devestating impact on a number of plant and animal habitats, these habitats are being destroyed to make room for these plantations.


## What is the Palm Oil campaign? 

Supporters of the Palm Oil campaign realise that they cannot completely stop brands and companies from using Palm Oil in their products. Instead,they should strive to ensure that they support and instead use Sustainable Palm Oil. 

Chester Zoo suports the Sustainable Palm Oil Campaign, they state that their mission is "preventing extinction, and a big part of that is aiming to be a major force in conserving biodiversity worldwide." As well as supporting the Sustainability of Palm Oil, Chester Zoo "carry out work directly in habitats around the world affected by palm oil production."

WWF raise awareness on the impact that Palm Oil has, their website is incredibly useful in learning about Palm Oil. Their website states that "In 2012, the UK Government recognised that we were part of the Palm Oil problem and could also be part of the solution. They set a commitment for 100% of the Palm Oil used in the UK to be from sustsainable sources that do not harm people or nature." This Government commitment proved to be helpful for the Palm Oil campaign, the WWF website states that in "2019, 70% of the total palm oil imports to the UK were sustainable".
